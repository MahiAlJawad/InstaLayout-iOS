# InstaLayout-iOS

## Overview

Instagram like layout using Compositional Layout and Diffable Datasource

This implementation uses the following latest techniques/approaches in Swift released by Apple:

1. Diffable Datasource
2. Compositional Layout (Multisection)
3. Reording in CollectionView with diffable datasource

It also used the latest Async-await approach for downloading Photos from API
But you can simply ignore the data fetching part. As the intention of this project is just to use
Diffable Datasource and Compositonal layout in implementation of Instagram like layout and replace 
the old Flow layout and UICollectionViewDatasource.
